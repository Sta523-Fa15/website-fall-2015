# The why of testing

## Why test

* Validation

* Reproducibility

* Better code structure

* Better ability to refactor

* Better code quality

* Better documentation

* Reduces frustration


## Testing as validation

Software validation is hard (really really hard)

* Software involves a huge number of complex processes interacting with one another

* Proving 

> A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. - Douglas Adams

## Testing as documentation

It is pretty easy to write down basic feature requirements for software (see HW1), it is really hard to write down *all* of the requirements without any ambiguity. 

There is an impedance mismatch between spoken/written language and code - testing is a chance to explicitly *show* requirements instead of just describing (*tell*) them.



## Testing workflow

Your code will always have bugs, and we should try to minimize them as much as possible - but being careful isn't enough.

Necessary to plan for what to do if and when we find a bug (most important thing is that once we have made a mistake we want to make sure that we will not make it again).

Idealized workflow:

* Find a bug

* Write a test to detect the bug - *test(s) should fail initially*

* Fix the bug - *test(s) should pass now*

# Introduction to testthat

## testthat's structure

testthat uses a heirarchical structure for the organization of tests:

* Individual tests are constructed using an `expectation`, which runs code and compares it to an expected result.

* expectations for the same or very similar functions are grouped together within a `test` along with any scaffolding code (e.g. object initialization).

* Finally, collections of tests are grouped into a `context`

## expectations (old way) {.smaller}

In testthat expectations are constructed using the `expect_that` function which is given an object and some condition to test using that object. Conditions are specified using builtin condition functions. 

<div class="centered">
`expect_that(obj, cond())`
</div>

<br/>

<div class="columns-2">
* `is_true`: truth

* `is_false`: falsehood

* `is_a`: inheritance

* `equals`: equality with numerical tolerance

* `equals_reference`: equality relative to a reference

* `is_equivalent_to`: equality ignoring attributes

* `is_identical_to`: exact identity

* `matches`: string matching

* `prints_text`: output matching

* `throws_error`: error matching

* `gives_warning`: warning matching

* `shows_message`: message matching

* `takes_less_than`: performance

* ...
</div>

## Examples {.smaller}

<div class="columns-2">
```{r, error=TRUE}
expect_that(1, equals(1))
expect_that(1, equals(2))

m = matrix(1:4,2,2)
expect_that(m, is_a("matrix"))
expect_that(m, is_equivalent_to(1:4))
expect_that(m, is_identical_to(1:4))

v1 = 1:4
v2 = c(a=1L,b=2L,c=3L,d=4L)
expect_that(v1, is_equivalent_to(v1))
expect_that(v1, is_identical_to(v2))

expect_that(1, equals(1.01, tolerance=0.01))
expect_that(1, equals(1.01, tolerance=0.1))
```
</div>

## Expectation shortcuts (new way) {.smaller}

<div class="columns-2">
* `expect_true`

* `expect_false`

* `expect_is`

* `expect_equal`

* `expect_equal_to_reference`

* `expect_equivalent`

* `expect_identical`

* `expect_match`

* `expect_output`

* `expect_error`

* `expect_warning`

* `expect_message`

* `expect_more_than`

* `expect_less_than`

* `expect_named`

* `expect_null`
</div>

## Examples (redux) {.smaller}

<div class="columns-2">
```{r, error=TRUE}
expect_equal(1, 1)
expect_equal(1, 2)

m = matrix(1:4,2,2)
expect_is(m, "matrix")
expect_equivalent(m, 1:4)
expect_identical(m, 1:4)

v1 = 1:4
v2 = c(a=1L,b=2L,c=3L,d=4L)
expect_equivalent(v1, v2)
expect_identical(v1, v2)

expect_equal(1.01,1,tolerance=0.01)
expect_equal(1.01,1,tolerance=0.1)
```
<br/>
</div>


## Grouping expectations (tests) {.smaller}

```{r, error=TRUE}
totitle = function(x) 
{
  s = strsplit(x, " ")[[1]]
  paste(toupper(substring(s, 1, 1)), substring(s, 2), sep = "", collapse = " ")
}

test_that("string tests", {
  str1 = "Hello World!"
  str2 = totitle(str1)
  str3 = totitle(tolower(str2))
  str4 = totitle(toupper(str3))

  expect_equal(str1, str2)
  expect_equal(str1, str3)
  expect_equal(str1, str4)
})
```

## Revising totitle {.smaller}

```{r, error=TRUE}
totitle = function(x) 
{
  s = strsplit(x, " ")[[1]]
  paste(toupper(substring(s, 1, 1)), tolower(substring(s, 2)), sep = "", collapse = " ")
}

test_that("string tests", {
  str1 = "Hello World!"
  str2 = totitle(str1)
  str3 = totitle(tolower(str2))
  str4 = totitle(toupper(str3))

  expect_equal(str1, str2)
  expect_equal(str1, str3)
  expect_equal(str1, str4)
})
```


## contexts, files, and directories

The general approach is to group tests into logical subgroups:

* a context is a description / label that is applied to all subsequent tests, and (maybe) shown by the reporter when running the tests

* in general the preferences is for one context per test file (R script) - a single test file can be run using `test_file` (like source but it doesn't pollute the global environment)

    * the goal for these test files is to be entirely self contained

* all test files are contained in single directory - these test files can be run (in alphabetical order) using `test_dir`


## Exercise 1

Write at least a half-dozen tests using `testthat` to evaluate if the following function is correct. Your tests should include checks for correct output when given valid input as well as the appropriate behavior when given invalid input.

Once you have your tests rewrite `fib` as `fib2` such that the new function successfully passes all of your tests.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fib = function(n)
{
  stopifnot(is.integer(n))

  if (n < 2)
      return(n);

  return( fib(n-1L) + fib(n-2L) );
}
```
