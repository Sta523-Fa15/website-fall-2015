### Text Editor:

When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is optimized for writing code. There is a huge variety of options out there, if you do not already have a preferred editor try and few and see which one works best for you. 

* vim / emacs - old school unix console based editors, they have a steep learning curve but are incredibly powerful.

* nano - another unix console editor, easier learning curve but with much less power.

* SublimeText - crossplatform GUI text editor with a robust plugin ecosystem


### Git:

Git is a state-of-the-art version control system. It lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code on [github](https://github.com/).

* OSX - install Git for Mac by downloading and running [the installer](http://git-scm.com/downloads) or install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) and use it to install git via `brew install git`. 

* Unix / Linux - you should be able to install git via your prefered package manager (if it is not already installed).

* Windows - install Git for Windows by download and running the git for windows [installer](http://msysgit.github.io/). This will provide you with git, the bash shell, and ssh in windows.



### Unix shell(s) / ssh:

We will be doing much of the work in the class on remote linux systems, primarily we will be interacting with these machine through a remote terminal and a shell. Using a shell gives you more power to do more tasks more efficiently with your computer.

* OSX / Unix / Linux - these tools should already be installed and you should be able to access your shell through the Terminal application (name may vary slightly depending on your OS).

* Windows - there are several ways to install bash or a bash-like shell, the preferred method is to install the [git for windows package](http://msysgit.github.io/) as detailed above. 


### R:

[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R (initially), we will primarily be using [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), an interactive development environment (IDE).

* We will mostly be using a browser based version of RStudio on a remote server but you can also install a local version of the [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop).
